## Project task
Project task was to build a simple website showing cards for activities and for the person who we're tracking and then display hours spent on certain activities fetched from JSON file provided, and user should be able to switch between daily, weekly and monthly tracking of hours.

## Project overview
I picked out this project because I'm still working on my JavaScript skills and this seemed like a fun way to test them out a bit more. Had a little trouble with the design of the cards and pictures but I've managed to make it look somewhat okay as I was not that focused on the design on this project rather than on functionality. Biggest problem I'v encountered in JavaScript would have to be looping through the data and displaying it on correct places, however I've managed to work it out and make it all work. 

Design of the project could use a bit more work to fix some minor issues, but I think the rest doesen't need updating.
